What is Phishing?
Phishing is a social engineering attack designed to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and financial details.
It is often the first step in a larger attack strategy,to gain initial access to targeted systems.

Step 1: Create a GitHub Account ======>
Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one.
Go to GitHub and follow the prompts to create an account.

Step 2: Create a New Repository ======>
Once logged into GitHub, click on the "New Repository" button.
Name the repository (e.g., xyz-org-demo).
Choose whether the repository is public or private (for educational purposes, public can be beneficial to show transparency).
Initialize the repository with a README file.

Step 3: Setting Up GitHub Pages ======>
Navigate to the repository settings.
Under the GitHub Pages section, change the source branch from "None" to "main".
You can use a custom domain, or for testing purposes, use a free domain through services like (https://www.noip.com)
Create an account with No-IP and set up a free domain.

Point this domain to the public IPv4 address of your GitHub repository (refer to GitHub’s custom domain documentation)
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site.

3. Building a Phishing Website (for Educational Purposes Only) ======>
Important: In this section, focus on demonstrating the setup of a phishing page to understand not to encourage any harmful actions.
Step 4: Design the Phishing Page ======>
Create an HTML page that mimics a legitimate service (e.g., a fake login page for a popular website).
Use social engineering techniques to make the page look realistic. This can include:
Copying the design of the target website.
Using convincing language to lure users into entering sensitive information.

Step 5: Deploy the Page via GitHub Pages ======>
Once the page is designed, push the content to your GitHub repository.
The phishing page will be available via your custom domain or GitHub’s default URL (e.g., yourusername.github.io/repository-name).
